print("""Welcome to Wordle!!!

Your goal is to guess the mystery word of the day!

Here are the rules:

1. No word has the same letter twice. Example 'booth' is not a word, as it has 2 o's.
2. Green means the letter is correct in the right place, yellow means correct in the wrong place, and grey is just plain wrong!
3. You are allowed to guess words that don't exist; however, you only have 5 guesses instead of the normal 6.
4. Only guess 5 letter words.
5. Have fun!!!
